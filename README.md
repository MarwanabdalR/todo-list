# Kanban Board

A task management board built with **Next.js**, **MUI**, and **React Query**. Tasks live across four columns — To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done — and you can drag them between columns, search across all of them, and paginate within each one all linked with NEXT.js APIs and Json files no need to use database.

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- npm (comes with Node)

---

## First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install json-server globally (the mock API)
npm install -g json-server
```

---

## Running the app

You need **two terminals** — one for the API, one for the app.

**Terminal 1 — start the mock API:**

```bash
json-server --watch ./DB/db.json --port 4000
```

**Terminal 2 — start the dev server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

> The app talks to `http://localhost:4000/tasks`. If that port isn't running, you'll see an error banner on the board.
